This build has CUDA NVIDIA GPU features enabled since it was compiled with the `--features candle` option. This means that the `modkit open-chromatin predict` subcommand will use the Candle backend and is suitable for use with NVIDIA GPUs. There are a few points to keep in mind:

1. Whilst this backend should be compatible with a lot of NVIDIA GPUs, it may not work with ALL GPU-equipped compute setups.
2. This backend is still 1-3x slower than the Torchlib backend.

Basically, use this build if you have a NVIDIA GPU and want to get a quick start without downloading additional software. You can find additional information about how Candle works with Burn here: https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn?tab=readme-ov-file#backend
