This build of Modkit has been compiled against libtorch version 2.6.0+cu118 (hash: 2236df1770800ffea5697b11b0bb0d910b2e59e1) using the `--features tch` option. This is the fastest way to use `modkit open-chromatin` but requires a little more set up.

To use this build, you should download and extract libtorch like this:

wget -O libtorch.zip https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu118/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.6.0%2Bcu118.zip
unzip libtorch.zip

Then set the following environment variables:

export LIBTORCH={path/to/}libtorch
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBTORCH}/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}

You can check that everything is working by running `modkit open-chromatin predict <args> --dryrun`.

In our testing this version of torchlib is compatible with a wide range of NVIDIA GPUs, but it may not be compatible with all versions.

If this distribution isn't compatible with your setup the recommendation is so compile Modkit from source:

1. Download the version of libtorch for your CUDA version: `https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/${CUDA_VERSION}/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.6.0%2B{CUDA_VERSION}.zip`, see the example above.
2. Download rust `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
3. Clone Modkit: `git clone --depth 1 --branch <modkit version> https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit.git`
4. Build Modkit: `cd modkit && cargo build --release --features tch`

Then follow the instructions above.
